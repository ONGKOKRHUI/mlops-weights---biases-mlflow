Bug Report 1
Problem: unable to log model as artifact, it shows running and uploading and succeed but did not see in the wandb UI
Recreate: run python main_2.py
What I tried:
- using artifact.wait() to prevent session killed when uploading (failed)
- using os.environ["WANDB_HTTP_TIMEOUT"] = "300" (failed)
- using pytorch method to only store weights (failed)
- isolate model logging using a mock model (succedded)
- demodularise the testing code to enable avoid modularisaion session confusion (failed)
